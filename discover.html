												<h3>Frequent Events</h3>
											</header>
											<p>We enjoy offering many ways to experience Minecraft as a community. Our server's vanilla experience is non PvP,
however we are committed to providing external game mode-based events, picked by staff or by the community. Such events
are not limited to being hosted on the server, but can also be for other games or other events. All events are open to everyone, bringing
our community together.</p>

We have navigation tools such as the Dynmap to assist you in finding helpful locations, or you can simply ask any of our friendly members for assistance, in-game or via Discord. </p></div>

												<h3>Trade and Faith</h3>
											</header>
											<p>We believe that putting faith and trust into our people strengthens a community. As such, our server provides no formal protection system. However, although griefing and stealing is possible, any attempts will result in a restoration and a perpetrator ban. For trade, we have a designated section of spawn for the shopping district with a simple system using chests and signs to indicate the prices of items being sold. Trade is an integral part of our server as it promotes collaboration and allows for faster progress in your server experience. </p>
